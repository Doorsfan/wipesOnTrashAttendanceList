This is a very small webserver project, that performs webscraping utilizing Playwright and renders it unto a locally hosted Website. We use it in my guild in World of Warcraft - to help with seeing who has not signed up to upcoming events.

It utilizes Pug to generate HTML markup, Node.JS for a small Express server backend, Ngrok for tunneling and a few other dependencies.

This project was my first real step into making my own little Web development project - Where i wanted to explore Web development and webscraping.

This tool was primarily developed with the sole intent of being a form of Dev tool - not a Responsively designed website intended for
paying Customers or otherwise stated - Primarily a tool and a learning experience to be able to showcase practical work.
